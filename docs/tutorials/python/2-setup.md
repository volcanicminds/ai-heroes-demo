We'll be using [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) as our package manager and to set up our project.

The A2A libraries we'll be using require `python >= 3.12` which [uv can install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) if you don't already have a matching version. We'll be using python 3.12.
