## Agent Card

Remote Agents that support A2A are required to publish an **Agent Card** in JSON format describing the agent's capabilities/skills and authentication mechanism. Clients use the Agent Card information to identify the best agent that can perform a task and leverage A2A to communicate with that remote agent.

### Discovery

We recommend agents host their Agent Card at `https://DOMAIN/.well-known/agent.json`. This is compatible with a DNS approach where the client finds the server IP via DNS and sends an HTTP `GET` to retrieve the agent card. We also anticipate that systems will maintain private registries (e.g. an 'Agent Catalog' or private marketplace, etc). More discussion can be found in [topic: Agent Discovery](../topics/agent-discovery.md).

### Representation

Following is the proposed representation of an Agent Card

```typescript
// An AgentCard conveys key information:
// - Overall details (version, name, description, uses)
// - Skills: A set of capabilities the agent can perform
// - Default modalities/content types supported by the agent.
// - Authentication requirements
interface AgentCard {
  // Human readable name of the agent.
  // (e.g. "Recipe Agent")
  name: string;
  // A human-readable description of the agent. Used to assist users and
  // other agents in understanding what the agent can do.
  // (e.g. "Agent that helps users with recipes and cooking.")
  description: string;
  // A URL to the address the agent is hosted at.
  url: string;
  // The service provider of the agent
  provider?: {
    organization: string;
    url: string;
  };
  // The version of the agent - format is up to the provider. (e.g. "1.0.0")
  version: string;
  // A URL to documentation for the agent.
  documentationUrl?: string;
  // Optional capabilities supported by the agent.
  capabilities: {
    streaming?: boolean; // true if the agent supports SSE
    pushNotifications?: boolean; // true if the agent can notify updates to client
    stateTransitionHistory?: boolean; //true if the agent exposes status change history for tasks
  };
  // Authentication requirements for the agent.
  // Intended to match OpenAPI authentication structure.
  authentication: {
    schemes: string[]; // e.g. Basic, Bearer
    credentials?: string; //credentials a client should use for private cards
  };
  // The set of interaction modes that the agent
  // supports across all skills. This can be overridden per-skill.
  defaultInputModes: string[]; // supported mime types for input
  defaultOutputModes: string[]; // supported mime types for output
  // Skills are a unit of capability that an agent can perform.
  skills: {
    id: string; // unique identifier for the agent's skill
    name: string; //human readable name of the skill
    // description of the skill - will be used by the client or a human
    // as a hint to understand what the skill does.
    description: string;
    // Set of tag words describing classes of capabilities for this specific
    // skill (e.g. "cooking", "customer support", "billing")
    tags: string[];
    // The set of example scenarios that the skill can perform.
    // Will be used by the client as a hint to understand how the skill can be
    // used. (e.g. "I need a recipe for bread")
    examples?: string[]; // example prompts for tasks
    // The set of interaction modes that the skill supports
    // (if different than the default)
    inputModes?: string[]; // supported mime types for input
    outputModes?: string[]; // supported mime types for output
  }[];
}
```
